我最初的梦想是改变世界 。
上高中的时候，被《石头门》所感染，想着成为一名程序员兼设计师，希望有朝一日能够创造出能够改变人们生活的作品。
然后上大学了，因为各种原因，一开始选择了机械，但我并不开心（有点抑郁）。
有一天突然想要去一个没人认识我的地方，重新开始。
后来我想要追求自己的兴趣，转专业到计算机，过上了边努力边悠闲的小日子。
但我发现计算机很多时候是枯燥无味的。
于是便陷入了迷茫。
现在我成为了外乡人，改变世界太难，我想先认识世界，真诚待人，包容万物。
我从来都是个混子，但是我想为这个世界献出一点点微小的贡献。

## First dream
My first dream is to change the world.
In high school, Infected by  "Steins; Gate", I wanted to be a programmer and designer, hoping one day I could create something that could change people's life.
Then at college, because of several reasons, I chose mechanical as my major, But I was unhappy(or depressed).
One day, I suddenly want to go to a place where no one knows me and restarted.
Then I wanted to escape my interest, changed my major to computer, and began my hard-working and leisure time.
But I find it is boring most of the time.
Thus I get lost.
Now I have become an outlander, it is so difficult to change the world, I think I should get to know this world first, be sincere to people, inclusive of all.
I am not a hard-working man at all, but I want to make a small contribution to this world.
