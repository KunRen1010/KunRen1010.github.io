Hello! over the past two days, I didn't want to see anything about my studies, I AM SO TIRED. maybe I am not tried, just don't know where I should go, I want to be a designer and computer engineer, but I am not sure how to achieve my goal. I suddenly realize that I am not good at studying by myself, and my mind is a little bit exhausted. Although I have done something unrelated studies, like inited my computer and changed my computer system from Windows to Ubuntu for a quiet working environment.So just start from here again.
